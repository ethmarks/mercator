A collection of interactive web apps exploring the Mercator map.

These demos were used in my post about the 1569 Mercator World Map. Read the post here: <https://ethmarks.github.io/posts/mercator>

**[Try it live →](https://ethmarks.github.io/mercator/greenland/)**

A simple interactive demonstration of how the Mercator projection distorts the size of landmasses at different latitudes. Drag Greenland around the world and watch how its apparent size changes due to projection distortion.
